# CrunchSpoofer-Crack
Pasted HWID Spoofer "Made" by people who just want fast and easy money. little to no coding experience and using other peoples work to benefit themselves.

- Bad Security (Key Auth & Bad Debugging Checks)
- Using Public/Free drivers from github to "spoof" hwid information
- Using Public/Free Cleaners
- Using Public/Free MAC spoofing software

In conclusion Crunch Services are scamming your money and using free software (which they are selling) as a spoofer
